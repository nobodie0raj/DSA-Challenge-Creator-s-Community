Welcome to the DSA Challenge!

We are excited to launch a comprehensive 6-month journey into Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), specifically tailored for 2nd and 3rd-year students. This program is designed to build a solid foundation in DSA, crucial for academic success, campus preparation, and resume building.

## Program Overview

Our DSA Challenge will run from **June 7, 2024, to January 7, 2025**, covering the most important topics to ensure a thorough understanding and practical application of DSA concepts. Whether you're preparing for your exams, internships, or job placements, this challenge will equip you with the necessary skills.

## Topics Covered

1. **Learn the Basics**
2. **Important Sorting Techniques**
3. **Solve Problems on Arrays**
4. **Binary Search** (1D, 2D Arrays, Search Space)
5. **Strings**
6. **Linked Lists** (Single LL, Double LL, Medium, Hard Problems)
7. **Recursion** (PatternWise)
8. **Bit Manipulation** (Concepts & Problems)
9. **Stack and Queues** (Learning, Pre-In-Post-fix, Monotonic Stack, Implementation)
10. **Sliding Window & Two Pointer Combined Problems**
11. **Heaps** (Learning, Medium, Hard Problems)
12. **Greedy Algorithms**
13. **Binary Trees** (Traversals, Medium and Hard Problems)
14. **Binary Search Trees** (Concept and Problems)
15. **Graphs** (Concepts & Problems)
16. **Dynamic Programming** (Patterns and Problems)
17. **Tries**
18. **Advanced Strings**

## How It Works

1. **Identify the Problem**
